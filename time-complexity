Time complexity is defined in terms of how many times it takes to run a given algorithm, based on the 
length of the input. Time complexity is not a measurement of how much time it takes to execute a 
particular algorithm because such factors as programming language, operating system, and processing 
power are also considered.

Time complexity is a type of computational complexity that describes the time required to execute an 
algorithm. The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of time it takes for each statement to 
complete. As a result, it is highly dependent on the size of the processed data. It also aids in 
defining an algorithm's effectiveness and evaluating its performance.
